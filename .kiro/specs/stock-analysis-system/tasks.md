## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Best Practices

1. **Code Quality Standards:**
   - Follow PEP 8 for Python code style
   - Use type hints and Pydantic models for data validation
   - Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names

2. **Testing Requirements:**
   - Achieve minimum 90% test coverage for core components
   - Write tests before implementing features (TDD approach)
   - Use pytest for unit testing and pytest-asyncio for async tests
   - Implement integration tests for critical workflows

3. **Security Considerations:**
   - Never commit secrets or credentials to version control
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - Implement proper input validation and sanitization
   - Follow OWASP security guidelines for web applications

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Use async/await for I/O-bound operations
   - Implement caching strategies for expensive computations
   - Optimize database queries with proper indexing
   - Monitor and profile application performance regularly

### Task Execution Order

Tasks should be executed in the order presented, as later tasks depend on earlier implementations. However, within each phase, some tasks can be executed in parallel by different team members:

- **Phase 1:** Sequential execution recommended for foundation
- **Phase 2:** Tasks 5-8 can be executed in parallel after Phase 1 completion
- **Phase 3:** Tasks 9-12 can be executed in parallel after Phase 2 completion
- **Phase 4:** Tasks 13-17 can be executed in parallel after Phase 3 completion

### Success Criteria

Each task is considered complete when:
1. All specified functionality is implemented and working
2. Unit tests are written and passing with adequate coverage
3. Integration tests validate the feature works with existing components
4. Code review is completed and approved
5. Documentation is updated to reflect the new functionality

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for building the comprehensive Stock Analysis System, ensuring each component is properly tested, documented, and integrated with the overall architecture.
