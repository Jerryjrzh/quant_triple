# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive stock analysis system that leverages calendar-based temporal analysis as its core foundation. The system integrates opportunity identification, risk assessment, stock screening strategies, and review marking capabilities to create a complete decision support loop for stock trading and investment analysis.

The system's unique approach centers on "Spring Festival Alignment Analysis" - using Chinese New Year as a temporal anchor point to normalize and compare historical stock performance patterns. This is combined with institutional fund tracking, quantitative screening, and intelligent risk management to provide a holistic investment decision platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Calendar-Based Temporal Analysis Engine

**User Story:** As a stock analyst, I want to analyze stock performance patterns aligned to Spring Festival dates, so that I can identify seasonal trends and timing opportunities based on Chinese market cycles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a stock symbol THEN the system SHALL retrieve at least 10 years of historical daily price data with post-adjustment for splits and dividends
2. WHEN historical data is processed THEN the system SHALL identify Spring Festival dates for each year and use them as temporal anchor points
3. WHEN Spring Festival alignment is performed THEN the system SHALL normalize price data relative to each year's Spring Festival date with configurable time windows (e.g., 60 days before/after)
4. WHEN multiple years of aligned data exist THEN the system SHALL generate overlay charts showing historical performance patterns relative to Spring Festival timing
5. WHEN seasonal patterns are calculated THEN the system SHALL identify and mark historical top/bottom points within the seasonal cycles

### Requirement 2: Multi-Dimensional Stock Screening System

**User Story:** As an investor, I want to screen stocks using combined technical, seasonal, and institutional criteria, so that I can identify investment opportunities that align with multiple favorable factors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the screening interface THEN the system SHALL provide filters for technical indicators (RSI, MACD, moving averages, etc.)
2. WHEN I set screening criteria THEN the system SHALL allow combination of seasonal factors (current position in Spring Festival cycle, historical strength periods)
3. WHEN institutional analysis is enabled THEN the system SHALL include filters for recent institutional activity (new fund positions, dragon-tiger list appearances, shareholder changes)
4. WHEN screening is executed THEN the system SHALL return a ranked list of stocks meeting all specified criteria
5. WHEN screening results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show key metrics and mini-charts for each result

### Requirement 3: Institutional Fund Tracking and Analysis

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to track institutional fund movements and behaviors, so that I can align my positions with smart money and identify potential breakout opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN institutional data is collected THEN the system SHALL gather dragon-tiger list data, top 10 shareholder information, and block trade records
2. WHEN fund activity is analyzed THEN the system SHALL categorize institutions by type (mutual funds, social security funds, QFII, hot money)
3. WHEN institutional patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL tag stocks with labels like "new institutional entry", "hot money activity", "chip concentration"
4. WHEN institutional analysis is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide institutional attention scores (0-100) based on activity strength and recency
5. WHEN historical institutional data exists THEN the system SHALL overlay institutional activity markers on price charts

### Requirement 4: Dynamic Risk Management System

**User Story:** As a risk-conscious investor, I want automated risk assessment and monitoring, so that I can manage position sizes and exit timing based on quantified risk metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN risk analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL calculate historical volatility and Value at Risk (VaR) for individual stocks
2. WHEN seasonal risk assessment is enabled THEN the system SHALL adjust risk ratings based on historical high-risk periods identified in Spring Festival alignment analysis
3. WHEN market anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL trigger system-wide alerts for extreme market conditions (e.g., index drops >3% in 15 minutes)
4. WHEN dynamic stop-loss is calculated THEN the system SHALL set stop-loss levels based on volatility rather than fixed percentages
5. WHEN risk metrics are displayed THEN the system SHALL show confidence intervals and maximum potential daily losses

### Requirement 5: Interactive Visualization and Chart Analysis

**User Story:** As a visual analyst, I want interactive charts with Spring Festival overlay capabilities, so that I can visually identify patterns and mark important trading points for future reference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a stock chart THEN the system SHALL display the Spring Festival alignment overlay chart with multiple years of data
2. WHEN I interact with the chart THEN the system SHALL provide time axis sliding/zooming controls for detailed period analysis
3. WHEN I filter chart data THEN the system SHALL allow dynamic selection/deselection of specific years for comparison
4. WHEN I hover over chart elements THEN the system SHALL display detailed information with auto-highlighting of the selected data series
5. WHEN I mark trading points THEN the system SHALL allow interactive marking of entry/exit points with associated notes and analysis

### Requirement 6: Stock Pool Management and Organization

**User Story:** As an organized trader, I want to manage multiple stock pools with different purposes, so that I can categorize and track stocks based on their analysis stage and investment intent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create stock pools THEN the system SHALL allow creation of multiple named pools (watchlist, core holdings, potential opportunities)
2. WHEN I manage pool contents THEN the system SHALL support adding/removing stocks from pools with drag-and-drop or one-click operations
3. WHEN screening results are available THEN the system SHALL allow direct import of screening results into specified stock pools
4. WHEN I view stock pools THEN the system SHALL display each stock with mini-charts and key performance indicators
5. WHEN pool management is active THEN the system SHALL maintain pool history and allow restoration of previous pool states

### Requirement 7: Automated Monitoring and Alert System

**User Story:** As a busy investor, I want automated monitoring of my watchlist stocks with time-based and condition-based alerts, so that I can be notified of important opportunities and risks without constant manual checking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring is configured THEN the system SHALL automatically check watchlist stocks daily for predefined conditions
2. WHEN seasonal triggers are detected THEN the system SHALL send alerts when stocks enter historical opportunity or risk windows
3. WHEN technical conditions are met THEN the system SHALL notify users when stocks meet specified technical indicator thresholds
4. WHEN institutional activity occurs THEN the system SHALL alert users to significant new institutional positions or dragon-tiger list appearances
5. WHEN alerts are generated THEN the system SHALL deliver notifications through multiple channels (UI notifications, email, mobile push)

### Requirement 8: Review and Feedback Learning System

**User Story:** As a learning trader, I want to mark and analyze my trading decisions with systematic review capabilities, so that I can improve my strategy through data-driven feedback and parameter optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I mark trading points THEN the system SHALL record entry/exit points with timestamps, prices, and associated reasoning notes
