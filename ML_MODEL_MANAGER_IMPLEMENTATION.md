# ML Model Manager Implementation Summary

## Overview

Task 7.1 "Implement MLflow integration for model lifecycle" has been successfully completed. This implementation provides comprehensive ML model lifecycle management capabilities for the Stock Analysis System.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core ML Model Manager (`stock_analysis_system/analysis/ml_model_manager.py`)

A comprehensive ML model management system with the following features:

#### Key Classes:
- **`ModelMetrics`**: Data class for storing model performance metrics
- **`ModelInfo`**: Data class for storing model metadata and information
- **`DriftDetectionResult`**: Data class for drift detection results
- **`MLModelManager`**: Main class for model lifecycle management

#### Core Features:

**Model Registration and Versioning:**
- Register models with MLflow tracking and model registry
- Automatic versioning and metadata tracking
- Support for custom metrics and artifacts
- Tag-based model organization

**Model Promotion Workflows:**
- Promote models from staging to production
- Automatic archiving of previous production models
- Status tracking (training, staging, production, archived)

**Drift Detection and Monitoring:**
- Statistical drift detection using KL divergence and KS tests
- Feature-level drift analysis
- Configurable drift thresholds
- Confidence scoring for drift detection

**Automated Retraining Scheduling:**
- Multiple schedule types (periodic, drift-based, performance-based)
- Automatic detection of models due for retraining
- Configurable retraining intervals

**Model Comparison and A/B Testing:**
- Compare multiple models on test datasets
- Support for multiple evaluation metrics
- Performance benchmarking capabilities

**Model Management Operations:**
- Load models from MLflow registry
- List and filter models by status or name
- Archive old or unused models
- Comprehensive model information retrieval

### 2. Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/test_ml_model_manager.py`)

Full test coverage including:
- Model registration and promotion tests
- Drift detection tests (with and without drift)
- Retraining scheduling tests
- Model comparison tests
- Model management operation tests
- Error handling and edge case tests

### 3. Demo Application (`test_ml_model_manager_demo.py`)

A comprehensive demonstration script showing:
- Model registration with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
- Model promotion workflows
- Drift detection with simulated drift scenarios
- Automated retraining scheduling
- Model comparison and A/B testing
- Model management operations

### 4. Integration Test (`test_ml_model_manager_integration.py`)

Simple integration test verifying:
- Basic model lifecycle operations
- Integration with MLflow
- Core functionality validation

## Technical Implementation Details

### MLflow Integration
- Uses MLflow 2.16.2 for model tracking and registry
- Supports both local and remote MLflow tracking servers
- Automatic experiment creation and management
- Model artifact logging and retrieval

### Configuration Integration
- Integrated with existing `config/settings.py`
- Uses `MLSettings` class for configuration
- Environment variable support for all settings
- Configurable drift thresholds and retraining intervals

### Drift Detection Algorithm
- **KL Divergence**: Measures distribution differences between reference and new data
- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**: Statistical test for distribution comparison
- **Feature-level Analysis**: Individual feature drift scoring
- **Confidence Scoring**: Based on consistency across features

### Performance Features
- Async/await support for non-blocking operations
- Efficient data processing with NumPy and pandas
- Configurable batch processing for large datasets
- Memory-efficient drift detection algorithms

## Usage Examples

### Basic Model Registration
```python
from stock_analysis_system.analysis.ml_model_manager import MLModelManager, ModelMetrics

# Initialize manager
ml_manager = MLModelManager()

# Register a model
model_id = await ml_manager.register_model(
    model_name="stock_predictor",
    model_object=trained_model,
    metrics=ModelMetrics(accuracy=0.85, precision=0.83, recall=0.87, f1_score=0.85, custom_metrics={}),
    tags={"version": "1.0", "type": "classification"},
    description="Stock prediction model"
)
```

### Drift Detection
```python
# Detect drift
drift_result = await ml_manager.detect_model_drift(
    model_id=model_id,
    new_data=new_data,
    reference_data=training_data,
    feature_names=feature_names
)

if drift_result.drift_detected:
    print(f"Drift detected! Score: {drift_result.drift_score}")
```

### Model Promotion
```python
# Promote to production
success = await ml_manager.promote_model_to_production(model_id)
if success:
    print("Model promoted to production")
```
