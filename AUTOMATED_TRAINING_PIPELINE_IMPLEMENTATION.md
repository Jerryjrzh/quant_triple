```

### Model Support

#### Default Model Configurations
The system includes pre-configured models:

1. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Parameters: n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, max_features
   - No scaling required

2. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
   - Parameters: n_estimators, learning_rate, max_depth, subsample
   - No scaling required

3. **Logistic Regression**
   - Parameters: C, penalty, solver
   - Scaling required

### Key Algorithms

#### Feature Selection Strategy
1. **Multiple Selection Methods:** Uses both f_classif and mutual_info_classif
2. **Intersection-Based Selection:** Takes features selected by multiple methods
3. **Fallback Strategy:** Uses union if intersection is too small
4. **Configurable K:** Allows specification of desired feature count

#### Time-Series Data Splitting
```python
# Calculate split indices for chronological order
test_start = int(n_samples * (1 - test_size))
val_start = int(test_start * (1 - validation_size))

# Split maintaining temporal order
X_train = X.iloc[:val_start]
X_val = X.iloc[val_start:test_start]  
X_test = X.iloc[test_start:]
```

#### Deployment Decision Logic
```python
# Compare new model with existing production model
performance_improvement = new_score - existing_score

# Deploy only if improvement exceeds threshold
should_deploy = performance_improvement >= rollback_threshold
```
