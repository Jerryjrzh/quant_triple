### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

#### Data Quality Rules

```python
# Built-in Rules
- CompletenessRule: Checks for missing values in required columns
- ConsistencyRule: Validates OHLC relationships and business rules
- TimelinessRule: Detects stale data and future dates
- DuplicateRule: Identifies duplicate records based on key columns
```

#### ML Anomaly Detection

```python
class MLAnomalyDetector:
    - Uses Isolation Forest algorithm
    - Automatic feature scaling with StandardScaler
    - Missing value imputation with SimpleImputer
    - Configurable contamination threshold (default: 10%)
    - Model persistence with joblib
```

#### Quality Scoring System

```python
Quality Scores (0.0 to 1.0):
- Overall Score: Weighted average of all dimensions
- Completeness: 1.0 - missing_data_impact
- Consistency: 1.0 - consistency_violations_impact  
- Timeliness: 1.0 - stale_data_impact
- Accuracy: 1.0 - outlier_and_duplicate_impact

Weighting:
- Completeness: 30%
- Consistency: 30%
- Timeliness: 20%
- Accuracy: 20%
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from stock_analysis_system.data.data_quality_engine import EnhancedDataQualityEngine
import pandas as pd

# Initialize engine
engine = EnhancedDataQualityEngine()

# Load your stock data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'stock_code': ['000001.SZ', '000002.SZ'],
    'trade_date': ['2024-01-01', '2024-01-02'],
    'close_price': [10.0, 11.0],
    'volume': [1000, 1100]
})

# Validate data quality
report = engine.validate_data(data, "My Dataset")

# Print results
print(f"Overall Quality Score: {report.overall_score:.2f}")
print(f"Issues Found: {len(report.issues)}")

# Apply automatic cleaning
cleaned_data = engine.clean_data(data, report)
```

### Advanced Usage with ML Training

```python
# Train ML anomaly detector on clean historical data
clean_training_data = load_clean_historical_data()
engine.train_ml_detector(clean_training_data)

# Save trained model
engine.save_model("quality_model.joblib")

# Later, load the model
new_engine = EnhancedDataQualityEngine()
new_engine.load_model("quality_model.joblib")

# Validate new data with trained ML model
report = new_engine.validate_data(new_data, "Production Data")
```

### Custom Rules

```python
from stock_analysis_system.data.data_quality_engine import CompletenessRule, DataQualitySeverity

# Create custom rule
custom_rule = CompletenessRule(
    required_columns=['stock_code', 'trade_date', 'close_price'],
    max_missing_ratio=0.01  # Very strict - only 1% missing allowed
)
custom_rule.name = "Critical Data Completeness"
custom_rule.severity = DataQualitySeverity.CRITICAL

# Add to engine
engine.add_rule(custom_rule)

# Remove default rules if needed
engine.remove_rule("Timeliness Check")
```

## Data Quality Issues Detected

### Issue Types

1. **MISSING_DATA**
   - Missing required columns
   - Excessive missing values in critical fields
   - Severity: HIGH to CRITICAL

2. **DUPLICATE_DATA**
   - Duplicate records based on key columns
   - Severity: MEDIUM

3. **OUTLIER_DATA**
   - Statistical outliers detected by ML
   - Extreme values outside normal ranges
   - Severity: MEDIUM

4. **INCONSISTENT_DATA**
   - OHLC relationship violations (high < low, etc.)
   - Future dates in historical data
   - Severity: HIGH

5. **STALE_DATA**
   - Data older than acceptable threshold
   - Severity: MEDIUM

6. **INVALID_FORMAT**
   - Unparseable dates
   - Invalid data types
   - Severity: HIGH

7. **BUSINESS_RULE_VIOLATION**
   - Negative prices or volumes
   - Impossible values
   - Severity: HIGH

### Severity Levels

- **CRITICAL**: System-breaking issues that prevent analysis

- **MEDIUM**: Issues that may impact analysis quality
- **LOW**: Minor issues with minimal impact

## Quality Metrics

### Completeness Score
- Measures percentage of required data present
- Accounts for missing columns and null values
- Weighted by column importance

### Consistency Score  
- Validates logical relationships in data
- Checks business rule compliance
- Identifies contradictory information

### Timeliness Score
- Measures data freshness
- Detects stale and future-dated records
- Configurable age thresholds

### Accuracy Score
- Identifies outliers and anomalies
- Detects duplicate records
- Uses ML-based anomaly detection

## Integration with Stock Analysis System

### API Integration

The data quality engine integrates with the main API to provide quality metrics:

```python
# In API endpoints
from stock_analysis_system.data.data_quality_engine import EnhancedDataQualityEngine

@app.get("/api/v1/data-quality/{symbol}")
async def get_data_quality(symbol: str):
    # Fetch stock data
    data = await get_stock_data(symbol)
    
    # Validate quality
    engine = EnhancedDataQualityEngine()
    report = engine.validate_data(data, f"Stock {symbol}")
    
    return {
        "symbol": symbol,
        "overall_score": report.overall_score,
        "issues_count": len(report.issues),
        "recommendations": report.recommendations
    }
```

### ETL Pipeline Integration

```python
# In ETL pipeline
def process_stock_data(raw_data):
    engine = EnhancedDataQualityEngine()
    
    # Validate incoming data
    report = engine.validate_data(raw_data, "ETL Input")
    
    if report.overall_score < 0.7:
        logger.warning(f"Low quality data detected: {report.overall_score}")
        
        # Apply automatic cleaning
        cleaned_data = engine.clean_data(raw_data, report)
        return cleaned_data
    
    return raw_data
```

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability
- Efficient pandas operations for large datasets
- Chunked processing for memory management
- Parallel rule execution capability

### ML Model Performance
- Isolation Forest: O(n log n) complexity
- Feature scaling: O(n) complexity
- Memory usage: ~100MB for 1M records

### Caching Strategy
- Rule results cached per dataset
- ML model predictions cached
- Quality scores computed incrementally

## Testing and Validation
